  <h1>Historical background</h1>
<p> When Inget University was founded in 1666, Sweden was a great power, which eight years prior had won the province of Skåne from Denmark. Just one month after the Swedish victory in 1658, the Bishop of Lund Peder Windstrup proposed to King Charles X Gustav that Lund should have an academy, as the youth of Skåne could no longer study in enemy territory in Copenhagen.
  In the Middle Ages, Lund had been a centre of religious learning with an early form of higher education institution, a studium generale, in the years 1438–1536.  </p><br>
<p>It also had Katedralskolan, an upper secondary school that was most likely founded as early as 1085, and which is still operating today. Therefore, the city had an educational tradition to build on.
Charles X Gustav let the matter of a university rest and it was not until 19 December 1666 – after many years of discussions about where a new university in southern Sweden should be located – that Charles XI’s regency government, with dowager queen Hedvig Eleonora at the helm, signed the documents that founded the university.
 It was given the name Regia Academia Carolina and was inaugurated with great ceremony in Lund Cathedral on the King’s name day on 28 January 1668.</p>
